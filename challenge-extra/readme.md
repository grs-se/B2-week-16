# **Advanced Multi-Page Responsive Website Challenge with CSS Reset Debugging**

## **Challenge Overview**  

In this challenge, you will build a **fully responsive, multi-page website** while troubleshooting and correctly implementing a **CSS reset stylesheet**. The website should incorporate **modern layout techniques, CSS variables, and pseudo-elements**, ensuring a structured, maintainable design. Additionally, you will need to **diagnose and fix issues** related to the CSS reset to ensure that styles are applied correctly across different browsers.

- Adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (**desktop, tablet, mobile**).

- Use at least **one pseudo-element or pseudo-class** (e.g., `:hover`, `::before`, `::after`).
- Implement a **styled navigation bar** that links to each page.
- Ensure proper **spacing and alignment** across different sections.

### **4. Functional and Styled Contact Page**
Your **Contact Page** should feature a **styled form** that includes:
- Fields for **name, email, and message**.
- A **submit button** with hover effects.
- Proper **form validation** (basic HTML5 validation like `required` fields).

### **5. Code Quality and Best Practices**
- Ensure your HTML is **semantic** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Keep CSS **organized, readable, and well-commented**.
- Follow **accessibility best practices** (e.g., use proper contrast, label form elements).
